🎉 Hortator has been deployed!

1. Verify the operator is running:
   kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l app.kubernetes.io/name={{ include "hortator.name" . }}

2. Install the CLI:
   go install github.com/hortator-ai/Hortator/cmd/hortator@latest

3. Create your first agent task:
   hortator spawn --prompt "Hello, world!"

   Or with kubectl:
   kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
   apiVersion: core.hortator.ai/v1alpha1
   kind: AgentTask
   metadata:
     name: hello-world
   spec:
     prompt: "Say hello and introduce yourself"
     timeout: 5m
   EOF

4. Check task status:
   hortator status hello-world
   # or
   kubectl get agenttasks

5. View task logs:
   hortator logs hello-world

{{- if .Values.presidio.enabled }}
NOTE: The Presidio PII analyzer runs as a centralized service. When agent pods
terminate, the Presidio container may briefly show exit code 137 (SIGKILL) in
events — this is expected behavior during pod lifecycle transitions and does
not indicate a problem. A preStop hook is configured to minimize this.
