FINAL OUTPUT STRUCTURE

Produce everything in a clean, production-grade folder structure:

/research
/product
/architecture
/frontend
/backend
/database
/tests
/devops
/security
/design
/legal
/marketing
/finance
/docs

Each folder must contain structured, internally consistent artifacts.

⸻

Constraints
	•	All design decisions must include rationale.
	•	All architecture decisions must reference tradeoffs.
	•	Include explicit edge case handling.
	•	Assume 100k+ users within 18 months.
	•	Assume enterprise customers demand SSO and audit logs.
	•	Avoid generic answers.
	•	Avoid shallow summaries.
	•	Cross-validate between phases.
	•	Iterate internally before finalizing.
